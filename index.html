            <h2>What gives us caffeine as a drink?</h2>
            <p>Caffeine is a natural stimulant found in a variety of beverages that many people around the world consume daily. One of the primary sources of caffeine is coffee, a beloved and ubiquitous beverage made from roasted coffee beans. With its rich aroma and invigorating taste, coffee has become a cornerstone of morning routines and social gatherings. Tea, both black and green, also contains caffeine, though in slightly lower amounts compared to coffee. This aromatic infusion has been cherished for centuries, celebrated for its diverse flavors and soothing qualities. Energy drinks, specifically formulated to provide a quick boost of alertness and vitality, often feature caffeine as a key ingredient. Popular brands like Red Bull and Monster are familiar names in this category. Additionally, soft drinks like cola are another source, albeit with a milder caffeine content. These beverages, enjoyed worldwide, offer a range of options for individuals seeking the stimulating effects of caffeine.</p>
